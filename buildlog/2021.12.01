1100 ! need to test viability of CPU  
       o plan to use VME backplane for signal control
         o horizontal backplane, cards slot in vertically
           +. VME backplane has screw terminals for power
           +. screw terminals rest on surface, will short
           -- use standoffs
             +. do not have standoffs
1114         - acquire from hardware store
         o use VME prototyping board and wirewrap CPU
         o use jumper headers direct into neighboring slots for signaling
         o select 5V power supply unit
           + VME backplane alone consumes 1.2A due to termination resistor network
           - located suitable PSU
