1100 ! need to test viability of CPU  
       o plan to use VME backplane for signal control
         o horizontal backplane, cards slot in vertically
           +. VME backplane has screw terminals for power
           +. screw terminals rest on surface, will short
           -- use standoffs
             +. do not have standoffs
1114         - acquire from hardware store
         o use VME prototyping board and wirewrap CPU
         o use jumper headers direct into neighboring slots for signaling
         o select 5V power supply unit
           + VME backplane alone consumes 1.2A due to termination resistor network
           - located suitable PSU
1420     ^. wirewrapping free-running board
           o using 74LS05 for reset initialization logic
           +. using 25MHz crystal oscillator as it is the only frequency i have
           - ordered a pair of 32.768MHz crystal oscillators
1852     o finished wirewrapping board
         +. no activity from CPU
         ^. troubleshooting
           $- faulty 74LS05 identified, all gates non-functional
         o no spare 74LS05s, using 74LS06 instead
           o placed order for 12 more 74LS05s
1939     o decided to modularize the reset control logic
         ^. wirewrapping reset control board
